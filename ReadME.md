### A BASIC â†’ C compiler

__Usage:__
```python compiler/teenytiny.py <filename>```

__Example:__
```python compiler/teenytiny.py hello.teeny```

<br>

__Output:__
The compiler will output the __C code__ as `out.c`. You can compile this with any regular C compiler.

<br>
I followed this tutorial to build this BASIC to C compiler. This was done for a university course project.
